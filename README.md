Cyclistic bike-share case study: data analysis of casual vs. member riders (Google Data Analytics Capstone)

On Kaggle: [Cyclistic Case Study - Casual vs Member Riders](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tiborjanosy/cyclistic-case-study-casual-vs-member-riders)

Project Overview:
This project is the Capstone Case Study for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.
The goal is to analyze Cyclistic (Divvy) bike-share data from Q1 2019 and Q1 2020 to understand how casual riders and annual members use the service differently.
By identifying usage patterns, the analysis provides data-driven business recommendations for converting casual riders into annual members — the company’s key strategy for long-term growth.

Dataset:
The dataset contains two CSV files:
Divvy_Trips_2019_Q1.csv
Divvy_Trips_2020_Q1.csv
